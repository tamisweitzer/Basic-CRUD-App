# Simple CRUD App

Simple CRUD App was made to practice basic CRUD operations. The backend is basic PHP connecting to a MySQL database. The frontend is basic HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap. There is no framework used.

This app is based off the the tutorial [Create a Simple CRUD Database App] by Tania Rascia.
