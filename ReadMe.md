# Simple CRUD App

Simple CRUD App was made to practice basic CRUD operations. The backend is basic PHP connecting to a MySQL database. The frontend is basic HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap. There is no framework used.

This app is based off the the tutorial [Create a Simple CRUD Database App](https://www.taniarascia.com/create-a-simple-database-app-connecting-to-mysql-with-php/) by Tania Rascia.
